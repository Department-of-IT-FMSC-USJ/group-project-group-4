// Payment Front-end Placeholder
// Owner: Nayanthi
// TODO:
// 1. build payment form validation, submission, and optimistic UI flows once api/payments.php is restored.
// 2. introduce order summary calculations and currency formatting helpers for each service funnel.
// 3. connect success/error messaging patterns and redirection logic used by the original checkout.
// 4. Coordinate shared utilities (formatters, validators) with the reborn shared-navigation/util bundle.
